                    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
                    <p>
                        Masaba Hope Center is a beacon of hope in a society engulfed by poverty and uncertainty. Located in the heart of Kuria, Migori County, we are a dedicated children's home committed to providing a safe haven for orphaned and vulnerable children. Our mission is to alleviate suffering, restore dignity, and empower the next generation to break free from the cycle of poverty.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In a world where many children face unimaginable hardships, Masaba Hope Center stands as a godsend, offering love, care, and opportunities to those who need it most. We believe that every child deserves a chance to dream, to grow, and to thrive. Through education, healthcare, and emotional support, we aim to nurture these young souls and equip them with the tools they need to lead successful lives.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our work extends beyond the walls of the children's home. We actively engage with the community, addressing systemic issues that perpetuate poverty and vulnerability. From providing access to clean water and healthcare to empowering women through skill development programs, we are committed to creating a brighter future for all.
                    </p>
                    <p>
